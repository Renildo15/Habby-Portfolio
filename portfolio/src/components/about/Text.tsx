                My name is Renildo, although many call me Habby. I am currently in the seventh period of the Information Systems course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). Since I started college in 2020, I entered the world of development. My preference is to work with the backend, but I also have frontend experience, which makes me a full-stack developer. Over time, I have honed my programming skills to provide more efficient and reliable solutions to customer needs.
